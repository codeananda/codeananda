# ü§ñ Adam Murphy | LLM Engineer | Document Processing Specialist

I transform complex document processing challenges into scalable AI solutions. My systems have:
- Processed 12M+ documents in 48 hours
- Slashed mortgage approval times by 52%
- Cut LLM costs by 75% while increasing accuracy

## üöÄ Recent Impact Projects
- Enterprise-scale payslip data extraction with dual-LLM verification - [link](https://github.com/codeananda/enterprise_payslip_data_extractor)
- UK Local Plan analysis pipeline processing 700+ plans weekly - [link](https://github.com/codeananda/local_plan_policy_summariser)
- Massive-scale document embedding system powering LandGPT - [link](https://github.com/codeananda/planning_doc_text_extract_embed)
- View detailed case studies in pinned repositories

## üí° Technical Philosophy
Most of my recent work lives in private repositories (NDAs, enterprise clients). What you see here are carefully documented case studies that showcase my approach to building robust, scalable LLM systems.
