# Hi! I'm Adam 👋

*A Machine Learning Engineer trying to make the world a better place, one ML model at a time.*

### 🚧 I'm Currently Working On...

**ChatGPT Development**

I'm excited about the new wave of innovation occurring due to the release of ChatGPT and other LLMs. I want to ride the wave to create powerful models that will transform our lives.

### 💪 Other Skills

I've spent a lot of time doing time series analysis and forecasting with libraries like Prophet, NeuralProphet, and TensorFlow. I know the Python Data Science stack inside out (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Weights & Biases, Matplotlib, Plotly, etc.). And I've written 40+ [technical articles](https://github.com/codeananda/technical_articles) teaching various ML concepts at different levels of difficulty.

### 🤔 Why `codeananda`?

The suffix "-ananda" comes from Sanskrit and means "bliss" or "happiness." I'm a spiritual person who loves meditation and yoga and wants to bring joy into all I do. So, I remind myself daily that I want my work (`code`) to bring happiness (`-ananda`).
