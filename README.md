### 🏗️ Currently Working On...

**LLM Development**

I'm excited about the new wave of innovation occurring due to the rise of open- and closed-source LLMs I want to use these technologies to create powerful models that transform our lives. 

**Recent Projects**

* [🔍 Fakt.ai](https://github.com/codeananda/fakt_ai/) - 
*Fully transparent, automated fact-checking powered by AI Agents*
* [🎓 Langy - The AI Language Tutor](https://github.com/codeananda/langy)
* [📄 Document Embedding Analysis](https://github.com/codeananda/document_embedding_analysis)

### 💪 Other Skills

I've spent a lot of time doing time series analysis and forecasting with libraries like Prophet, NeuralProphet, and TensorFlow. I know the Python Data Science stack inside out (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Weights & Biases, Matplotlib, Plotly, etc.). And I've written 40+ [technical articles](https://github.com/codeananda/technical_articles) teaching various ML concepts at different levels of difficulty. I'm skilled in Docker and have used AWS (particularly AWS Lambda) for deployment and as my main cloud compute provider.

### 🤔 Why `codeananda`?

The suffix "-ananda" comes from Sanskrit and means "bliss" or "happiness." I'm a spiritual person who loves meditation and yoga and wants to bring joy into all I do. So, I remind myself daily that I want my work (`code`) to bring happiness (`-ananda`).
